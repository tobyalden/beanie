- make getting on buddies better
- loading / saving stacks of buddies
- physics modifier when buddy stack gets taller?

+ popping buddies off stack
+ physics for inactive buddies
+ fix level loading to accomodate stacks of buddies (a level won't load if you dip into it with a tall stack, meaning the bottom could potentially get stuck in level geometry once it loads in)
    - could load all adjacent levels (this would also fix the "unmounted buddy reset" problem, sort of... they wouldn't reset till you got too far away)
- should buddies remember their location? currently unmounted buddies reset on screen reentry
