- fix level loading to accomodate stacks of buddies (a level won't load if you dip into it with a tall stack, meaning the bottom could potentially get stuck in level geometry once it loads in)
- loading / saving stacks of buddies
- popping buddies off stack
- physics modifier when buddy stack gets taller?
